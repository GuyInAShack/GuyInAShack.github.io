      <h2>about me</h2>
      <p><b>if you know me irl, pretend you did not see this. seriously. don't mention it and don't speak of it.</b> anyway for the rest of yalls, call me whatever the fuck you want, i'm not one to care. pronouns are whatever you wanna use, i'm fine with any (but those who know, know :P). not much to say about myself, just a young fella on the net trying to survive their GCSEs and shit, while periodically fucking about with literal ewaste...</p>
