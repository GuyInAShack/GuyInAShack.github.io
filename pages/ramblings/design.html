        <h2 style="text-align: left;">a little on how i've changed this site</h2>
        <p style="text-align: left;">funny story with all this, originally i just wanted to test web design that was compatible with older operating systems, so i decided github pages was probably the cheapest way to do it (since i don't have to pay for hosting or domains), and it does the job pretty well. it was pretty barren, but it functioned (kinda). then i got bored as shit again and decided "hey, why the fuck not, lets redo this!", so i spent a night that was meant for revision rewriting the entire site's code, to make what it is now. <br><br>first thing i did was just wipe it clean so i could start fresh, then i managed to get a basic framework going. it wasn't exactly what i'd call pretty; it was literally gray and white boxes with some filler text. then i spent a little time hunting some fonts down, chose one of my favourite colour schemes, and applied those. a wee bit of rounding later, and i got something close enough to its current state. i'll confess that the code behind this is absolutely god awful, since it's based on my pretty scrappy HTML knowledge from years ago, and whatever i could find online about how to do certain things, so half of the code is inconistent asf. but hey, doing this keeps my mind off darker stuff for a while, so i'd say it's a net positive in the end :D</p>
